        Welcome! This guide will give newcomers (aka. fresh wolfbait) an overview of mechanics, tasks and tips to start out in <i>Vintage Story</i>, but may even let experienced players find out the odd thing here and there that they did not know themselves.
        <p>
        I hope this guide will prove to be useful to you!<br>

        <div>
          You might already be familiar with games such as <i>Minecraft</i>, and the controls in <i>Vintage Story</i> are very similar, so it's likely you'll feel right at home. I would still recommend you glance over this section, since you do have a few more ways to interact with the game. This is just a quick overview of the most important controls and you can have a look at a more extensive list in the <i>Controls</i> settings.

            <summary>Changing hotbar keybindings</summary>
            <div>
              Personally, I like to keep my last 4 hotbar slots easily accessible on the keys <span class="key">Z</span><span class="key">X</span><span class="key">C</span><span class="key">V</span> (or <span class="key">Y</span> if you're on QWERTZ). This requires moving some keybindings however, so I put <i>"Switch offhand item"</i> on <span class="key">F</span>, and <i>"Open/close character inventory"</i> on <span class="key">I</span>.

            <summary>Missing HUD elements</summary>
            <div>
              Some players might find themselves lacking an important HUD element, such as the minimap (<span class="key">F6</span>), coordinates and facing (<span class="key">V</span>), block/entity info (<span class="key">B</span>) and block/entity interaction help (<span class="key">N</span>). This may be due to having pressed one of those keys by accident. If you are prone to doing that, I may recommend changing the keybinding to something you won't accidentally press, such as <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">\</span>. Note that you can also enable and disable these in the <i>Interface</i> settings.
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="info">
            <summary>Immersive Mouse Mode and the <span class="key">Alt</span> key</summary>
            <div>
              In the <i>Interface</i> settings, the game also offers an <i>"Immersive Mouse Mode"</i> option. Turning this on will prevent most ingame dialogs from taking away your first-person camera control, and block dialogs will appear floating above the blocks they belong to. Now you can move items between containers with the crosshair! To access your inventory, you will have to hold <span class="key">Alt</span> to unlock the mouse cursor.
              <p>
              But even without <i>Immersive Mouse Mode</i>, the <span class="key">Alt</span> key might still have its uses. It essentially inverts whether your mouse cursor is grabbed by the game. You can use it to rearrange your hotbar without opening your inventory, as well as turn your camera around even if you have any number of dialogs open, for example to access a chest that is hiding behind you.

        <h2 id="First_Day">Your First Day</h2>
        <div>
          Here is everything you might want to know for your first day(s) in Vintage Story.
          <p>
          When you start out in a new world, you're greeted by the outfit selection dialog, and another one that greets you, telling you about the <a href="Handbook">handbook</a> and a starter guide on the <a href="https://wiki.vintagestory.at/">official wiki</a> - which you won't need because you have this one.
        </div>
        
        <section>
          <h3 id="Character">Character</h3>
          <div>
            <img src="images/first_day/character_outfit.png" class="float-left" style="height: 12.5em;">
            <img src="images/first_day/character_stats.png" class="float-right" style="height: 12.5em;">
            In a newly created world, you will be able to pick your clothes from a very limited selection of tattered rags. If you accidentally close this dialog without clicking "Confirm Selection", it will reappear next time you join. And, if you're wondering: Yes, you can find more clothing while playing.
            <p>
            When you open your character dialog ingame (<span class="key">C</span>), which allows you to change your clothing and equipped <a href="#Armor" class="missing">armor</a>, an additional "Stats" dialog will appear next to it.
            <p>
            The nutrition bars will fill up as you eat foods in those categories. <a href="#Cooking" class="missing">Cooked meals</a> are an especially good way to fill multiple at once. This is important because you can <b>raise your maximum health</b> from 15 health points (by default) to a total of 25 when all 4 categories are full.
            <p>
            Health and satiety displayed here are also visible above the hotbar as the red and green bars to the left and right, respectively. If you're curious what the cog in the center does, read up on <i>Temporal Stability</i> mechanic in the handbook. The additional stats are affected by the <a href="#Armor" class="missing"></a>armor</a> you wear, but notably, carrying an item in your offhand raises your <i>hunger rate</i> by 25%.

          <summary>Death, respawning and setting your spawn</summary>
          <div>
            Remember the location you first start in a fresh world, because it's where you will be reappearing whenever you die. That is, until you get a rare item drop called <i>temporal gear</i>, which you use by holding <span class="mouse right"><span></span></span> until it disappears, setting your new spawn point.
            <p>
            Beware that, with the default world settings, you will drop your items on the ground, which you have some amount of time to retrieve. And, at this moment, there are no automatic death waypoints.<span class="more">1)</span>

          <h3 id="Handbook">Handbook</h3>
          <div>
            Before you jump right into the game, you should definitely be aware of the ingame <b>handbook</b>, which can be opened by pressing <span class="key">H</span>. You can also hover over an item in your hotbar, inventory or any container and press <span class="key">H</span> to directly jump to its page, or <span class="code">Sneak</span>+<span class="key">H</span> to do the same for blocks in the world.
            <p>
            The handbook allows you to read information about certain mechanics (such as <a href="#Smithing" class="missing">smithing</a>), how to create an item and what it can be used for. Navigate it using the search, or click on icons and links to move around.
            <p>
            In addition to it, you can also look at the previously mentioned <a href="https://wiki.vintagestory.at/">Vintage Story Wiki</a> for more in-depth information about certain topics.
          </div>

        <details class="suggest">
          <summary>Waypoint everything</summary>
          <div>
            Especially when starting out, and you don't have the <a href="#Inventory">inventory space</a> or place to call home, you might not be able to take everything useful or interesting with you. So be sure to set down waypoints by opening the map with <span class="key">M</span> and pressing <span class="mouse right"><span></span></span> on it.
            <p>
            Note that due to a bug this method doesn't work properly if you're playing on a multiplayer server at this time, and waypoints will only appear after you've reconnected. However, there's an alternative: Simply type <span class="code">/waypoint add [color] [name]</span> into the chat (<span class="key">T</span>) to create a waypoint where you stand. Editing using the map works fine, so you can easily change the icon.
          </div>
        </details>
        <details class="warn">
          <summary>Beware of the wolves! 🐺</summary>
          <div>
            Even if the game tells you that you have a number of days before monsters appear, you still have to watch out for the aggressive wildlife. Wolves and hyenas will hunt you down if you happen to get to close to them. If you hear howling, or even just the sound of a puppy barking, be very careful, and ready to run!
            <p>
            Male bighorn sheep (the ones with the large curvy horns) also don't like it when you get into their personal space, but fortunately they don't persue you unless provoked.

            Next, a flat grid of voxels will appear on the ground, some of them highlighted with an orange outline. While holding another item of the same material, knap away parts of the material until no highlighted voxel remains, either by holding down <span class="mouse left"><span></span></span>, or clicking repeatedly at your own pace. Note that you can <b>break multiple voxels away</b> by disconnecting them from the main work piece.
            <p>
            Consider sitting down using <span class="key">G</span> to get closer to the crafting surface. Once you're done and received your tool head - in this case, 2 <i>knife blades</i> - slap it into the 3x3 crafting grid in your inventory (<span class="key">E</span>) with a <i>stick</i> below to receive your finished tool.

            Especially once you have a <i>knife</i>, you can look around bodies of water for <i>cooper's reed</i>, which will give you <i>cattail</i>. Just 10 of these can be crafted into one <i>hand basket</i>, and 40 is enough to fill all of the bag slots you can see to the right of your hotbar. Each hand basket adds 3 slots to your previously non-existant inventory.
            <p>
            Later in the game you will gain access to larger bags: <i>Hunter bags</i> (4 slots) require killing a large non-aggressive animal for their medium hide, <i>linen sacks</i> (5 slots) only require 20 <i>flax fiber</i>, and <i>backpacks</i> (6 slots) require a long <a href="#Leatherworking" class="missing">leatherworking</a> process.

            <summary>Dropped bags contain their items</summary>
            <div>
              Each of the slots in your inventory corresponds to one of the bags you have equipped. You might notice this when you pick up an item and it goes into your inventory: The actual bag it ends up in shakes briefly. When a non-empty bag is dropped on the ground, it can only be picked up when there's a free bag slot next to your hotbar.
              <p>
              Keep this in mind when you frantically run to to collect your items after a death, or want to collect the items a friend (or foe) has dropped, or you might unknowingly leave something behind.

            The next worry you might have is your dwindling food bar. Thankfully, there are a number of options when it comes to gathering food:

              <td rowspan="2">
                Fully grown crops will drop vegetables or raw grain for you to eat. Check the top center to see if it's fully grown (with block/entity info HUD (<span class="key">B</span>) enabled). However, they also drop a seed bag, which is valuable and you shouldn't leave it behind, but it takes up equally valuable inventory space, and requires <a href="#Farming" class="missing">farmland</a> to plant.
                <p>
                I personally find <i>flax</i> to be one of the few crops worth grabbing, as it's pretty valuable. For anything else, <b>create a waypoint</b> and look for other food sources.

                Found in humid forests, they come in three varieties: Field mushroom (white), bolete (brown) and fly agaric (red). When harvested with a <i>knife</i>, they will regrow after a few days. Can you guess which one is poisonous?

            <summary>On wild crop growth</summary>
            <div>
              Crops that are not fully grown do not always drop a seed for you to replant. Therefore you might think it's common sense to leave these plants alone until they slowly grow up on their own. However, know that unlike crops that have been planted on <a href="#Farming" class="missing">farmland</a>, wild crop growth only occurs in the areas that are loaded around players.
              <p>
              Therefore, you might just want to pick up crops when you go on long exploration trips, far from anywhere you might be staying for a while.

          <div>
            With sunlight being limited, and night approaching, you might want to look into creating a safe spot for yourself. Here are some materials / methods you can use:
            
            <ul>
              <li>Dig a 2 blocks deep trench, so nothing besides a leaping wolf can get to you.</li>
              <li>Just dig up a bunch of <i>dirt</i> and build with it.</li>
              <li>Craft some <i>cob</i> with <i>dirt</i> and <i>dry grass</i>, gathered from harvesting <i>tall grass</i> with a <i>knife</i>.</li>
              <li><i>Hay</i> blocks made from <i>dry grass</i> are quick to break so they work well to close up entrances.</li>
              <li>You can build using the <i>logs</i> you <a href="#Tree_Farming" class="missing">chop down</a>. Perfect for load-bearing pillars!</li>
              <li>If you have the stones and some <i>clay</i>, you can craft fancy <i>cobblestone</i> blocks.</li>
              <li>Speaking of <i>cobblestone</i>, with some luck you can find and spruce up a ruin.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <img src="images/first_day/shelter_firepit.png" class="float-right" style="width: 173px;">
            Once you've made yourself reasonably comfortable, it's time to make a <b>fire!</b> First place a piece of <i>dry grass</i> on the ground using <span class="code">Shift</span>+<span class="mouse right"><span></span></span> and then follow up with 4 <i>firewood</i> - which you can get by placing an <i>axe</i> above some <i>logs</i> in the 3x3 crafting grid. This creates a basic <i>firepit</i>, which you now have to start using a <i>firestarter</i> - again hold <span class="code">Shift</span>+<span class="mouse right"><span></span></span> until it succeeds. When the <i>firepit</i> starts burning its temperature will start to rise, and will continue burning as long as you provide it with fuel.
            <p>
            Next, use some of those excess <i>sticks</i> you've gathered and turn them into <i>torches</i> by just placing them in the <i>firepit</i>. <i>Torches</i> can start fires even better than the <i>firestarter</i>, so you can throw the latter away. In your inventory they last forever, but keep in mind that they go out in rain if not covered by a block. Placed down, they burn out after 3 days.
            <p>
            A good way to spend part of the night is to do some <a href="#Clay_Forming" class="missing">clay forming</a>. If you don't like the darkness, 5 hours of it can also be skipped by making a <i>hay bed</i> with 3 <i>hay</i> blocks and sleeping in it.
