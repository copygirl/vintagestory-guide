        Welcome! This guide will give newcomers (aka. fresh wolfbait) an overview of mechanics, tasks and tips to start out in <a href="https://vintagestory.at/">Vintage Story</a>, but may even let experienced players find out the odd thing here and there that they did not know themselves.

        <summary>How to use this guide</summary>
        <div>
          Info boxes like this one will appear throughout this guide. Click to open / close them.
        </div>
        <div>
          The navigation to the left and any <a href="#">light blue</a> links will bring you to their relevant section. <a href="#" class="missing">Light pink</a> links are to sections which have not been written yet. Links to <a href="https://copy.mcft.net/vs/guide/">external sites</a> look like that.
        </div>
        <div>
          You already know that you can use your browser's back button to return to the previous page, but the same applies to links that move you elsewhere on the same page. So you can click on a topic that interests you, and then return to exactly where you were before in this guide by going back.
        </div>
        <div>
          When you encounter an item with a green link like this

          </div></a>, you can hover over or click it to see its recipe, for convenience. Feel free to try it out right now! But even if they're just shown like this <i class="nowrap"><img src="images/icons/stick.png" class="icon">stick</i>, keep in mind you can always use the ingame <a href="#Handbook">handbook</a> to find out more.

        <div>
          You might already be familiar with games such as <i>Minecraft</i>, and the controls in <i>Vintage Story</i> are very similar, so it's likely you'll feel right at home. I would still recommend you glance over this section, since you do have a few more ways to interact with the game. This is just a quick overview of the most important controls and you can have a look at a more extensive list in the <i>Controls</i> settings.

            <div>
              Personally, I like to keep my last 4 hotbar slots easily accessible on the keys <span class="key">Z</span><span class="key">X</span><span class="key">C</span><span class="key">V</span> (or <span class="key">Y</span> if you're on QWERTZ).

            <summary>Missing HUD elements</summary>
            <div>
              Some players might find themselves lacking an important HUD element, such as the minimap (<span class="key">F6</span>), coordinates and facing (<span class="key">V</span>), block/entity info (<span class="key">B</span>) and block/entity interaction help (<span class="key">N</span>). This may be due to having pressed one of those keys by accident. If you are prone to doing that, I may recommend changing the keybinding to something you won't accidentally press, such as <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">\</span>. Note that you can also enable and disable these in the <i>Interface</i> settings.
            </div>
          </details>
          <details class="info">
            <summary>Immersive Mouse Mode and the <span class="key">Alt</span> key</summary>
            <div>
              In the <i>Interface</i> settings, the game also offers an <i>"Immersive Mouse Mode"</i> option. Turning this on will prevent most ingame dialogs from taking away your first-person camera control, and block dialogs will appear floating above the blocks they belong to. Now you can move items between containers with the crosshair! To access your inventory, you will have to hold <span class="key">Alt</span> to unlock the mouse cursor.
            </div>
            <div>
              But even without <i>Immersive Mouse Mode</i>, the <span class="key">Alt</span> key might still have its uses. It essentially inverts whether your mouse cursor is grabbed by the game. You can use it to rearrange your hotbar without opening your inventory, as well as turn your camera around even if you have any number of dialogs open, for example to access a chest that is hiding behind you.

        <h2 id="First_Day">Your First Day</h2>
        <div>
          Here is everything you might want to know for your first day(s) in Vintage Story.
        </div>
        <div>
          When you start out in a new world, you're greeted by the outfit selection dialog, and another one that greets you, telling you about the <a href="#Handbook">handbook</a> and a starter guide on the <a href="https://wiki.vintagestory.at/">official wiki</a> - which you won't need because you have this one.
        </div>
        
        <section>
          <h3 id="Character">Character</h3>
          <div>

            <img src="images/first_day/character_stats.png" class="float-right" style="height: 12.5em;">
            In a newly created world, you will be able to pick your clothes from a very limited selection of tattered rags. If you accidentally close this dialog without clicking "Confirm Selection", it will reappear next time you join. And, if you're wondering: Yes, you can find more clothing while playing.
          </div>
          <div>
            When you open your character dialog ingame (<span class="key">C</span>), which allows you to change your clothing and equipped <a href="#Armor" class="missing">armor</a>, an additional "Stats" dialog will appear next to it.
          </div>
          <div>
            The nutrition bars will fill up as you eat foods in those categories. <a href="#Cooking" class="missing"><img src="images/icons/claypot.png" class="icon">Cooked meals</a> are an especially good way to fill multiple at once. This is important because you can <b>raise your maximum health</b> from 15 health points (by default) to a total of 25 when all 4 categories are full.
          </div>
          <div>
            Health and satiety displayed here are also visible above the hotbar as the red and green bars to the left and right, respectively. If you're curious what the cog in the center does, go and read up on the <i class="nowrap dotted"><img src="images/icons/temporal_gear.png" class="icon">Temporal Stability</i> mechanic in the handbook. The additional stats are affected by the <a href="#Armor" class="missing">armor</a> you wear, and notably, carrying an item in your offhand raises your <i>hunger rate</i> by 25%.

        <details class="info">
          <summary>Death, respawning and setting your spawn</summary>
          <div>
            Remember the location you first start in a fresh world, because it's where you will be reappearing whenever you die. That is, until you get a rare item drop called <i class="nowrap"><img src="images/icons/temporal_gear.png" class="icon">temporal gear</i>, which you use by holding <span class="mouse right"><span></span></span> until it disappears, setting your new spawn point.
          </div>
          <div>
            Beware that, with the default world settings, you will drop your items on the ground, which you have some amount of time to retrieve. And, at this moment, there are no automatic death waypoints.<span class="more">1</span>

          <h3 id="Handbook">Handbook</h3>
          <div>
            Before you jump right into the game, you should definitely be aware of the ingame <b>handbook</b>, which can be opened by pressing <span class="key">H</span>. You can also hover over an item in your hotbar, inventory or any container and press <span class="key">H</span> to directly jump to its page, or <span class="code">Sneak</span>+<span class="key">H</span> to do the same for blocks in the world.
          </div>
          <div>
            The handbook allows you to read information about certain mechanics (such as <a href="#Smithing" class="missing nowrap"><img src="images/icons/anvil_iron.png" class="icon">smithing</a>), how to create an item and what it can be used for. Navigate it using the search, or click on icons and links to move around.
          </div>
          <div>
            In addition to it, you can also look at the already mentioned <a href="https://wiki.vintagestory.at/">Vintage Story Wiki</a> for more in-depth information about certain topics.

          <div>
            Especially when starting out, and you don't have the <a href="#Inventory">inventory space</a> or place to call home, you might not be able to take everything useful or interesting with you. So be sure to set down waypoints by opening the map with <span class="key">M</span> and pressing <span class="mouse right"><span></span></span> on it.
          </div>
          <div>
            Note that due to a bug this method doesn't work properly if you're playing on a multiplayer server at this time, and waypoints will only appear after you've reconnected. However, there's an alternative: Simply type <span class="code">/waypoint add [color] [name]</span> into the chat (<span class="key">T</span>) to create a waypoint where you stand. Editing using the map works fine, so you can easily change the icon.

You might notice this when you pick up an item and it goes into your inventory: The actual bag it ends up in shakes briefly. When a non-empty bag is dropped on the ground, it can only be picked up when there's a free bag slot next to your hotbar.
            </div>
            <div>
              Keep this in mind when you frantically run to to collect your items after a death, or want to collect the items a friend (or foe) has dropped, or you might unknowingly leave something behind.
